      The Help to Buy ISA is available at a range of banks, building societies
      and credit unions to first-time buyers. When using a Help to Buy ISA to
      purchase a property, the Government will give you a bonus of 25% of your
      total savings, up to a maximum of Â£3,000. Please note that the Help to
      Buy ISA is a separate Government initiative to the Help to Buy Scheme.
