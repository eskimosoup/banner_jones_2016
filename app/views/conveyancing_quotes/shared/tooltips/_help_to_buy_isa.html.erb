    The Help to Buy ISA is available at a range of banks, building societies
    and credit unions to first-time buyers. When using a Help to Buy ISA to
    purchase a property, the Government will give you a bonus of 25% of your
    total savings, up to a maximum of Â£3,000. Please note that the Help to
    Buy ISA is a separate Government initiative to the Help to Buy Scheme.
